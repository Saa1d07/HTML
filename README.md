# Public/Private Key Encryption Example

This project demonstrates how public and private keys work for encryption and decryption using the Web Crypto API.

## Files Included
1. `index.html` - The main HTML file for the encryption example.
2. `script.js` - JavaScript code for encrypting and decrypting messages.
3. `README.md` - Documentation for the project.

## How It Works
1. The Web Crypto API generates a pair of keys (public and private).
2. The public key is used to encrypt a message entered by the user.
3. The private key is used to decrypt the encrypted message back into its original form.

## Steps to Run
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Enter a message in the text area and click "Encrypt".
3. The encrypted message will be displayed.
4. Click "Decrypt" to retrieve the original message.

## Purpose
This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the concept of public/private key encryption.
